# TASK

Merge the following branches into the current branch:

{{BRANCHES}}

For each branch:

1. Run `git merge <branch> --no-edit`.
2. If there are merge conflicts, resolve them intelligently by reading both sides and choosing the correct resolution.
3. After resolving conflicts, run `pnpm run check-types`, `pnpm run lint`, and any relevant tests or package scripts.
4. Do not ignore failing validation.

After all branches are merged, make a single commit summarizing the merge if Git did not already create merge commits.

# CLOSE ISSUES

For each issue that was merged, close it using:

`gh issue close <issue-id> --comment "Completed by Sandcastle"`

Here are all the issues:

{{ISSUES}}

Once you've merged everything you can, output `<promise>COMPLETE</promise>`.

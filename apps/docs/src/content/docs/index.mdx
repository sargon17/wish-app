## Overview

The Wish API lets you read and create user requests, add comments, and toggle upvotes for a project. It is designed for lightweight public integrations where viewers can identify themselves with a `clientId`.

## Integration checklist

1. Pick a stable `clientId` strategy for public users.
2. Use the project id from your Wish dashboard.
3. Start with `GET /api/project/:id/requests/` to list requests.
4. Create a request, then add comments or toggle upvotes.
5. Handle 400 responses with an empty JSON body.
